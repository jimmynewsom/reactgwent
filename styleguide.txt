The styling is not as consistent as it should be, but here is what it's supposed to be (might change later):
- Most variables names are camelCase. Variable names for fields in the csv files are in snake_case.
- Constants are ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
- File names are inconsistent, but should be PascalCase for React Components and snake_case for everything else.
- CSS class names are inconsistent, but should be dash-case(?).
